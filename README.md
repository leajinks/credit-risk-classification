# credit-risk-classification

In this repo, we compare two logistic regression machine learning models to predict the riskiness of different loan types based on their interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status.

Results

Model 1:
Healthy Loans
Accuracy: .99
Precision: .99
Recall: 1

High Risk Loans
Accuracy: 
Precision: .90
Recall: .83

Model 2:
Healthy Loans
Accuracy: .99
Precision: .99
Recall: 1

High Risk Loans
Accuracy: .99
Precision: .99
Recall: .84


Summary
While both models perform well, model 2 has slight improvements over model 1, particularly in regards to the precision for high risk loans. Since 
high-risk loans are generally more unpredictable than healthy loans, it's important to choose the model with the highest precision for this group.
